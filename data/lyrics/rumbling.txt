RUMBLING, RUMBLING!
IT'S COMING!
RUMBLING, RUMBLING!
BEWARE!
COMING FOR YOU!!

All I ever wanted to do was do right things
I never wanted to be the king, I swear!
All I ever wanted to do was save your life
I never wanted to grab a knife, I swear! (Swear)

(I'm) TEARLESS, (I'm) FEARLESS!
(I'm) BURNING, (I'm) BURNING!
YOU TELL ME WHAT HAVE I MISSED?
STILL WANDERING IN THE DEEP MIST

If I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
If I lose it all outside the wall
Live to die another day
I don't want anything
I'm just here to
BEWARE!

All I ever wanted to do was know what's out there
I refused to lose without a fight, oh yеah! (Woah-oh)
We're just too young, ignorant and innocent
Likе kids stay up all night in a tent, oh yeah!
HOW DO YOU SEE ME? (Oh yeah!)
AM I WHO I USED TO BE?
BEWARE!

Nobody knows what's inside of me
Nobody knows what's inside of me
Nobody knows what's inside of me, ahh

If I lose it all, slip and fall
Will you laugh at me?
If I lose it all, lose it all, all

If I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
If I lose it all outside the wall
Live to die another day
I don't want anything
I'm just here to

BEWARE!
(RUMBLING, RUMBLING!
IT'S COMING!
RUMBLING, RUMBLING!)
COMING FOR YOU!
(RUMBLING, RUMBLING!
IT'S COMING!
RUMBLING, RUMBLING!)
